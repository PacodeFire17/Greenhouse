=== NOTES HOW TO RUN TEST_MAIN.C LINUX UBUNTU === 

Run this command in the root of the project: 
gcc -I include -DTEST_MODE tests/test_main.c source/states.c -o tests/test_suite
Followed by: 
./tests/test_suite

Hardware tests require human observation. 
The desired output of the Hardware is printed on the console to be compared with the real outcome.
To run these tests currently there is no other way if not running the content of the if as if it was the main file.
